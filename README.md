# Godot Experiments

Some experiments using the [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) game engine.

These are ports of my
[PyGame experiments](https://github.com/Taffer/pygame-experiments/) (which
started as ports of my
[LÃ¶ve experiments](https://github.com/Taffer/love-experiments/) for now), we'll
see where this goes.

## Bribe me

Want to bribe me to work on more experiments, faster? Want to suggest an
experiment?

Always willing to entertain suggestions, but if you're asking me to do some
work, you have the option of fuelling it with coffee. ;-)
